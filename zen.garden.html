      Beauty of Zen Gardening
     </h1>
     <p1>
     Zen Garden is an informative website that allows you to connect with preexisting files and upload your own in order to progress one's skills in html and css. This site provides a template or a "garden in which one can lose themselves in the endless customization of the site. It really is like a zen garden using coding language as the sand granules and computers as the sand boxes.

     It acts as a zen garden because the sole purpose of the actual zen gardens are to engage the mind in a way that becomes so obsessed that it dissociates with other things that are often trivials and beneficial to let go. The website acts in this way in terms of coding through the downloadable html and css files to garden in. Zen garden offers everything necessary all the work required is just tinkering with different style options and layout essentials.

     The tinkering becomes mindless which allows the brain to relax and use develop those essential coding skills with the subliminal goal of proficiency in coding. It allows a large playground in which the mind can relax and enjoy itself, but at the same time, it is engaged and taking in patterns and learning.

     In the example dowload html file that is up currently has a paragraph off to the left that is apart from the main body. The designermade the choice to make the font cursive which draws attention. This attention is a good attention though, because this info goes through the essential action pieces. That way, when a person first sees a page, they are drawn to that paragraph.
